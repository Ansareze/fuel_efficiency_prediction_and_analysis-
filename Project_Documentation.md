# Fuel Efficiency Prediction Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project predicts automobile fuel efficiency (MPG) using 7 machine learning models. The goal is to identify the best model for predicting fuel consumption based on vehicle characteristics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Auto MPG dataset (398 vehicles)
- **Target**: MPG (Miles Per Gallon)
- **Features**: 7 numerical features (cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model_year, origin)

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Removed**: car_name column (irrelevant)
2. **Converted**: horsepower to numeric type
3. **Handled**: Missing values with median imputation
4. **Split**: 80% training, 20% testing

## Machine Learning Models
1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble tree-based method
3. **Support Vector Regression** - Kernel-based method
4. **Decision Tree** - Single tree model
5. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble method
6. **XGBoost** - Optimized gradient boosting
7. **LightGBM** - Light gradient boosting machine

## Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) - Lower is better
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) - Lower is better
- **R² Score** - Higher is better (0-1)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) - Lower is better
- **Explained Variance** - Higher is better (0-1)

## Results Summary

### Top Performing Models
1. **Random Forest Regressor**: R² = 0.9070 (90.7%)
2. **LightGBM**: R² = 0.9041 (90.4%)
3. **Gradient Boosting**: R² = 0.9014 (90.1%)

### Performance Categories
- **Excellent (R² ≥ 0.85)**: 4 models
- **Good (0.75 ≤ R² < 0.85)**: 2 models
- **Fair (0.65 ≤ R² < 0.75)**: 1 model

## Feature Importance Analysis

### Most Important Features
1. **Weight** - Strongest predictor (34.42 average importance)
2. **Acceleration** - Second most important (33.45)
3. **Model Year** - Third most important (29.61)

### Feature Consensus
- **Displacement**: Top 3 in 5/7 models
- **Weight**: Top 3 in 4/7 models
- **Model Year**: Top 3 in 4/7 models
